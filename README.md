## Hello Antlr

This project is an example of using Antlr4 to generate a parser and a lexer.  The parser and lexer are generated from the grammar in the file `Hello.g4`.

The project structure was created with the Create Java Project... command in vscode. To build and run the project, you need to install antlr version 4.9.3.  I used brew to install it.
```
brew install antlr4
```
